        <p style="color: #DBDEE1; width: 100%">
			After a bit of discussion, we decided to use Unity as tool for basic mechanics such as object rendering. This is so that we do not have the overhead of building a renderer from scratch. To do this we have been  learning how to use Unity. Although we are using Unity to do some basic operations, we are limiting ourselves to using Unity to only render scenes and create primitives. We are still building our own collision detection and particle movement simulator.

        <p style="color: #DBDEE1; width: 100%">
			In terms of deliverables, we are a little bit behind in our original plan. By this week, we planned to have both particle simulation and wind simulation done, but we have only finished wind simulation. We are researching how to model our particles and most efficiently calculate the forces acting on each particle. We are confident that we will be able to do particle simulation now that we have figured out how to use Unity. As for wind simulation, we are able to accurately model the pattern of wind with respected to other objects in the scene. Next is to make this wind be a force that influences particles in the scene.

        <h3 style="color: #4889ca"><b>New Schedule</b></h3>
		<h4 style="color: #84b8eb"><b>Week 1 4/1 - 4/7</b></h4>
		<p style="color: #DBDEE1; width: 100%">We spent this week figuring out how to use Unity. Most of this time was spent reading documentation and figuring out how to use scripts.
		</p>
		<h4 style="color: #84b8eb"><b>Week 2 4/8 - 4/14</b></h4>
		<p style="color: #DBDEE1; width: 100%">We spent this time creating a wind simulation. First we started with wind represented as cubes. Then, we added forces to this wind. Finally, we made the wind move around based on collisions with primitives and other wind particles in the scene.
		</p>
		<h4 style="color: #84b8eb"><b>Week 3 4/15 - 4/21</b></h4>
		<p style="color: #DBDEE1; width: 100%">We will spend this portion of time coding up our various particle representations as well as forces related to simulating these particles in real time. This week we will focus on making the simulations physically accurate. 
		</p>
		<h4 style="color: #84b8eb"><b>Week 4 4/22 - 4/28</b></h4>
		<p style="color: #DBDEE1; width: 100%">We will spend this portion of time coding up particle representations and forces so we can simulate these particles in real time. This week we will focus on making the simulations faster, with acceleration structures, hardware manipulation, and code optimization.
