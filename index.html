		<h3>Abstract</h3>

		<p stye="width: 100%">
			We created a procedural terrain generator
		</p>

		<h3>Technical Approach</h3>

		<h4>3D Perlin Noise</h4>

		<h4>Marching cubes</h4>

		<h4>Particle Simulation</h4>

		<p>
			For the particle system, we created a particle class with attributes such as position,
velocity, and radius. The particles are initialized with a random position within the plane
and added to a list of particles. Each particle starts with an initial downward velocity due
to gravity and the particle position is updated based on the current velocity. We used the
terrain vertices to determine when the particle collided with the terrain and bounced the
particle off the ground with a certain damping factor.</p>
<p>
We defined particle collisions using each particleâ€™s position and radius. We checked the
distance between each particle and moved the particles randomly to the side if there
was a collision to simulate elastic collisions between the particles. We attempted to use
terrain tangent vectors to calculate changes in direction due to collisions but we were
not able to complete this in time.
</p>
<p>
We added the particles to Unity by creating a list of prefabs which are located at the
positions defined by the particles in the particles list. We modeled petals and hail in
Blender and imported them into Unity, using the models as the object for the prefab.

        <p style="color: #17191A; width: 100%">
			After a bit of discussion, we decided to use Unity as tool for basic mechanics such as object rendering. This is so that we do not have the overhead of building a renderer from scratch. To do this we have been  learning how to use Unity. Although we are using Unity to do some basic operations, we are limiting ourselves to using Unity to only render scenes and create primitives. We are still building our own collision detection and particle movement simulator.

			In terms of deliverables, we are a little bit behind in our original plan. By this week, we planned to have both particle simulation and wind simulation done, but we have only finished wind simulation. We are researching how to model our particles and most efficiently calculate the forces acting on each particle. We are confident that we will be able to do particle simulation now that we have figured out how to use Unity. As for wind simulation, we are able to accurately model the pattern of wind with respected to other objects in the scene. Next is to make this wind be a force that influences particles in the scene.

        <h3 style="color: #4889ca"><b>New Schedule</b></h3>
		<h4 style="color: #84b8eb"><b>Week 1 4/1 - 4/7</b></h4>
		<p style="color: #17191A; width: 100%">We spent this week figuring out how to use Unity. Most of this time was spent reading documentation and figuring out how to use scripts.
		</p>
		<h4 style="color: #84b8eb"><b>Week 2 4/8 - 4/14</b></h4>
		<p style="color: #17191A; width: 100%">We spent this time creating a wind simulation. First we started with wind represented as cubes. Then, we added forces to this wind. Finally, we made the wind move around based on collisions with primitives and other wind particles in the scene.
		</p>
		<h4 style="color: #84b8eb"><b>Week 3 4/15 - 4/21</b></h4>
		<p style="color: #17191A; width: 100%">We will spend this portion of time coding up our various particle representations as well as forces related to simulating these particles in real time. This week we will focus on making the simulations physically accurate. 
		</p>
		<h4 style="color: #84b8eb"><b>Week 4 4/22 - 4/28</b></h4>
		<p style="color: #17191A; width: 100%">We will spend this portion of time coding up particle representations and forces so we can simulate these particles in real time. This week we will focus on making the simulations faster, with acceleration structures, hardware manipulation, and code optimization.
